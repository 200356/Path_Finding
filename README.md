# Path_Finding
A path finding visualizer that finds the shortest path between the start point and choosen end point.One can add restricted nodes(called 'walls') for complexity.
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used for calculating the shortest path.

Color Codes:-
1. Light Blue Color- Start point
2. Light Yellow Color- End point
3. Grey Color- Walls(Restricted Nodes)
4. Green Color- Visited Nodes
5. Red Color- Queued Nodes
6. Blue Color- Shortest Path

Keyboard and Mouse Controls:-
1. Left Mouse Click(Drag)- To create Walls
2. Right Mouse Click- To set end point
3. Down keyboard key- To Run the program
